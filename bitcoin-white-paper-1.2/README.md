# Bitcoin White Paper – Main Points

**Title:** Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System  
**Author:** Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)

---

## Problem Statement
- Online payments rely on **trusted third parties** (banks, PayPal, etc.).
- Issues:
  - High transaction costs  
  - Fraud and chargebacks  
  - Double-spending risk  

---

## Proposed Solution
- A **peer-to-peer electronic cash system**  
- Allows **direct payments** between users **without intermediaries**

---

## Core Innovation: Blockchain
- A **public distributed ledger** of all transactions
- Transactions are grouped into **blocks**
- Blocks are linked together → **chain of blocks (blockchain)**
- Secured by **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**

---

## Double-Spending Solution
- Once a block is confirmed, altering it requires redoing all PoW
- This makes tampering **computationally impractical**

---

## Incentives (Mining)
- Miners validate transactions and secure the network
- Rewarded with:
  - Newly minted **bitcoins**  
  - Transaction fees
- Creates a **self-sustaining system**

---

## Decentralization & Security
- No central authority controls Bitcoin
- Security increases as more nodes and computational power join
- **Consensus** is maintained by the majority of honest nodes

---

## In Short
Bitcoin is a **trustless, decentralized digital money system** that:
- Solves **double-spending**  
- Uses **blockchain + proof-of-work**  
- Enables **secure, peer-to-peer transactions** without banks
